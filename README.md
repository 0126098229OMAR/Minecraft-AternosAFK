# minecraft-bot
Hello! this is an afk bot made for a video.

## Rationale
I built this bot for Minecraft, coz its just useless to get a server that isnt 24/7.
## Implementation
This bot is built using JavaScript (a programming language I learnt specifically to build this bot) and mineflayer.
The bot only works upto 1.16.4.
if you have a higher version, just use ViaVersion, ViaBackwards and ViaRewind

## Prerequisites 
1. NodeJS
2. Minecraft

## Commands
Step 1: Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
Step 2: Change the port number and IP address to the SERVER ADDRESS, otherwise it will not work.
Step 3: Run `npm dev` to run the js file.

## Disclamer
i am not responsible if your server get deleted by aternos!
USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!
